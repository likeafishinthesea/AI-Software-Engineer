# AI Software Engineer
whatever you need to know if you want to be an AI Software Engineer. 

I update this repo to share my experiences as a software engineer who uses smart solutions to build smart and scaleable application. 
There are many resources or videos, but I did not one that gives you a big picture first, then jumps to the details. So, that is what
I am going to do here.


## Enterprise-AI
  I add many usecases that helps you to understand the core concepts of SW and AI-based products. so mostly in the Development phase. It is 
  very hard to show the deployment and security phase for an enterprice product, since they are deployed on a cloud (Azure, GCP, or AWS). 
  but I will try to explain the deployment challenges for each usecase as well.
